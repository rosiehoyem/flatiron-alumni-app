## Why a Flatiron Alumni Site?

So we can stay in touch! The beta version of the site includes:

###For Students:

* Student profile pages: These are basic profile pages that will link to your full LinkedIn profile, social media sites, Github, etc.
* A dashboard page including a simple embedded Google Calendar, embedded Twitter feed, and a list of recent projects.
* Project descriptions: Add projects with full descriptions, as well as screen shots. All contributors can add themselves to the project with a brief blurb about how they contributed.
* A job board: Employers will post jobs that will be visible on this page.
